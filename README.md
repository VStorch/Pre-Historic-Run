**Pre-Historic Run** is a 2D Endless Runner game developed in **Unity**, where you control a **saber-toothed tiger** sprinting across prehistoric South American landscapes. Dodge obstacles, collect pacas, survive seasonal changes, and try to beat your own high score.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

The player controls a constantly running saber‑toothed tiger. The main objective is to survive for as long as possible while the environment dynamically alternates between summer and winter, affecting visuals and atmosphere.

### Obstacles
- Rocks
- Tree logs
- Teratornis — a prehistoric bird that attacks from above

### Collectibles
- **Pacas**: function as in‑game currency (similar to coins)

### Score System
- **Current Distance**: how far the player runs in the current session.
- **High Score**: the maximum distance achieved so far.

### Environment
- Seasonal transitions between **summer and winter** over time.
- Parallax background system to enhance depth and immersion.
